# TrafficFlowRL

**TrafficFlowRL** is a research project aimed at optimizing travel time through intelligent traffic light control using
**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** in the **SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)** environment.

## Project Goal

The main goal of the project is to develop a reinforcement learning model capable of efficiently managing traffic lights
to:

- Reduce vehicle travel time.
- Decrease traffic congestion.
- Improve traffic flow.
